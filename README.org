** Introduction
This repository was created to host a development version of the 'fastled'
component for testing.

It has a minimal amount of functionality implemented to get the hardware (LEDs)
to work.

At the moment, the code assumes the following (hard coded):
- NEOPIXEL Chipset is set
- 8 LEDS
- attached to GPIO48

It should light up the 8 LEDs in green (0x00FF00).

**** Testing
This code was tested to work with:
- Heltec Wifi LoRa V3, ESP32-S3 board.
- WS2812B RGB LEDs, powered with 5V, signal 3.3V

** Configuration
In YAML require:
#+begin_src yaml
  esphome:
    ..
    libraries:
      - FastLED

  ..
  fastled_dev:
#+end_src

Please be aware that this configuration will try to download and use the latest
version of FastLED (currently 3.5.0)
